Notes
=====

Strata's supposed to be for big projects. It's not meant to replace
ConfigParser or argparse. Rather, build on those modules, and the
myriad other ways projects do their configuration.

Configuration here refers more to runtime/in-process configuration,
typically at application start-up time, as opposed to deployment-time
configuration, or configuration management/versioning
(puppet/cfengine-like things).
