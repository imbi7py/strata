# TODO/NOTES

* Need to ascertain unique Variables before they hit the ConfigSpec
  (or at least their names)
  * LayerSet could help here, but then Variables aren't unique across
    LayerSets/Envs/ConfigSpecs (gut says probably not an issue)

* More generally, generic JSON/INI configs
  * The whole "specialize" thing for prefixing, etc. isn't done yet


* Excise and rethink savings map
* Think about default values
* Validation/Converters
* Instantiate variables?
* Test and coverage
